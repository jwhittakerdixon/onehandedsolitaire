# onehandedsolitaire
My implimentation of one-handed solitaire, an entirely probabilistic edition of solitaire introduced to me by Sophie Collerton, who based her dissertation on the game (hence the main class file name).
I currently have no documention for my implimentation yet, however the code is heavily annotated for now.

The deck of cards is based on similar card-game implimentations and is free-standing, and so I plan on building other card games with the same engine (suggestions welcome).

The code is currently set to run 10,000 iterations, printing the number of cards left and the number of suit and value matches for each game played. At the end the average score and lowest and highest score are printed, along with an exmple of one winning deck found, if one existed.

It is worth noting that based on Sophie's dissertation the average score is about 6 lower than my implimentation. If you spot my oversight please let me know.
